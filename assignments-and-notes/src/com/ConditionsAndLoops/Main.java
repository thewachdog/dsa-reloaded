        shortcuts:
        fori - to generate for loop syntax

        - use while when you dont know the number of times the loop will run
            eg: print from 1 to 10
        - use for when we know how many times it is going to run
            eg: print input until user enters x

        do-while:
            - similar to while-loop
            - only diff is do-while will execute atleast once but while loop is not like that
